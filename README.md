3D point cloud compression is the process of reducing the amount of data required to represent a 3D point cloud. This can be done through various techniques such as octree-based methods, principal component analysis, and voxel-based methods. The goal of compression is to retain the important features of the point cloud while reducing the data size to enable more efficient storage and transmission. Compressed point clouds can be used in a variety of applications such as in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and surveying.
